## How to Run 

If you want to try Laura's Q-Learning algorithm, run:
`python FarmDeliverySystem.py q_learning`

After running Laura's Q-Learning algorithm once, if you want to run it for more episodes run:
`python FarmDeliverySystem.py q_learning prev_trained_table`

After running Laura's Q-Learning algorithm, if you want to try to visualize the current state, run:
`python FarmDeliverySystem.py prev_trained_table`

If you just want to use a naive algorithm, run:
`python FarmDeliverySystem.py`
